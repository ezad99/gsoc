Hello Everyone, I'm Ezad

I'm a second year Software Engineering student in Glasgow but I am originally from Malaysia. I have had about 2 years experience with Python and have learned the Django framework over the past year.
As a beginner in open-source contributions, I have much to learn but I am fully commited in putting in the work and I always strive to learn new things no matter how long it takes me.
My hope in participating in GSoC is to learn as much as I can about open source contributing and upgrading my programming skills. I am certain that I will be a great asset to the Wagtail community üòÅ
